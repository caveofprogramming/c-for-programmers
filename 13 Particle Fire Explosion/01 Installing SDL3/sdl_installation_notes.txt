On Windows I downloaded the pre-built mingw x86 binaries, unzipped and used them to compile like this:
gcc main.c -o fire -I ..\..\x86_64-w64-mingw32\include\ -L ..\..\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib -l SDL3

Programs failed silently till I copied SDL3.dll into the program directory.
- copy x86_64-w64-mingw32/bin/SDL3.dll to program directory.

On Mac, I install cmake and git using brew. 
I downloaded the SDL3 source, built and installed it.

Note: target 10.13 has to be changed to your Mac OSX version.

git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL
cd SDL
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.13
cmake --build .
sudo cmake --install .

Then I determined the correct compiler settings using 
pkg-config

I installed pkg-config using brew.

pkg-config --cflags --libs sdl3 
-I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib -lSDL3

On an old Mac this I had to delete rpath, to give:
gcc *.c -o fire -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lSDL3

On a newer Mac this worked fine
-I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib -lSDL3

except since I was using PowerShell, I actually had to write
-I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib "-Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib" -lSDL3
to avoid "missing parameter in argument list".
